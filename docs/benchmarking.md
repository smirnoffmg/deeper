# Performance Benchmarking Plan

This document outlines the plan for benchmarking the performance of the new worker pool system in Deeper. The goal is to evaluate the impact of the new system on the application's performance and ensure that it meets the desired performance goals.

## 1. Objectives

- To measure the performance of the new worker pool system under various loads.
- To compare the performance of the new system with the previous concurrency model.
- To identify any performance bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
- To validate that the new system effectively limits concurrency and prevents resource exhaustion.

## 2. Metrics

The following metrics will be collected during the benchmarking process:

- **Execution Time:** The total time taken to process a given set of inputs.
- **CPU Usage:** The percentage of CPU utilized by the application.
- **Memory Usage:** The amount of memory consumed by the application.
- **Goroutine Count:** The number of active goroutines during the execution.
- **Traces Processed per Second:** The number of traces processed per second.
- **Error Rate:** The number of errors that occur during the execution.

## 3. Tools

The following tools will be used for benchmarking:

- **Go's built-in testing and benchmarking framework:** For writing and running benchmark tests.
- **`pprof`:** For profiling CPU and memory usage.
- **`htop` or `top`:** For monitoring system resource usage in real-time.
- **Custom scripts:** For generating test data and automating the benchmarking process.

## 4. Scenarios

The following scenarios will be tested:

### 4.1. Baseline Scenario

- **Description:** A baseline test will be performed using the previous concurrency model to establish a performance baseline.
- **Configuration:** `DEEPER_MAX_CONCURRENCY` will be set to its default value of 10.
- **Input:** A small set of traces (e.g., 100) will be used as input.

### 4.2. High-Load Scenario

- **Description:** A high-load test will be performed to evaluate the performance of the new system under heavy load.
- **Configuration:** `DEEPER_MAX_CONCURRENCY` will be varied (e.g., 10, 20, 50, 100) to measure the impact of different concurrency levels.
- **Input:** A large set of traces (e.g., 1,000 or more) will be used as input.

### 4.3. Stress Test Scenario

- **Description:** A stress test will be performed to evaluate the stability of the new system under extreme load.
- **Configuration:** `DEEPER_MAX_CONCURRENCY` will be set to a high value (e.g., 200 or more) to push the system to its limits.
- **Input:** A very large set of traces (e.g., 10,000 or more) will be used as input.

## 5. Procedure

1.  **Set up the environment:** Set up a dedicated environment for benchmarking to ensure consistent and reproducible results.
2.  **Generate test data:** Generate the necessary test data for each scenario.
3.  **Run the benchmarks:** Run the benchmark tests for each scenario and collect the metrics.
4.  **Analyze the results:** Analyze the collected metrics and compare the performance of the new system with the baseline.
5.  **Generate a report:** Generate a report summarizing the findings of the benchmarking process.

## 6. Expected Outcomes

- The new worker pool system will demonstrate improved performance and stability compared to the previous concurrency model.
- The application will effectively limit the number of concurrent operations to the configured `DEEPER_MAX_CONCURRENCY` value.
- The benchmarking process will provide valuable insights into the performance characteristics of the new system and help identify any areas for further optimization.
